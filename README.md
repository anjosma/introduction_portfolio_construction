[Introduction to Portfolio Construction and Analysis with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-portfolio-construction-python) is 1/4 of the courses which is part of [Investment Management with Python and Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/investment-management-python-machine-learning) in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)

On this repository I'm applying the lessons of this course on some brazilian stock.
